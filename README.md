# Class-Notes1
Coupling and cohesion 
Unacceptable coheion (within module/class)
Trashbin 
Logical
(cheating F in Final) 
get F i the cource - It is temporal 

Level: temporal 
Justification: there is more than one way to get F 
it is not necessary to cheat to fail 
cheating (caught) in Final (not necessary to fail) 
gets F in the cource (bottom 3 &5 in almost every test item)

take 221 
take 322
it is procedural since you cant take 322 unless you pass 221 (p>0.95)
linear regression (LR: Machine learning is essentially linear regression) 
-----------Scatter Plot 

Module: 
being very smart (IQ>140)
make lot of money 

1) worst : trashbin : politically correct 
2) Temporal : Co relation 
(look notes for diagram ) 
Trashbin : uniformly distributed 

Very Smart/intelligent - very high GPA - Temporal - corelation - no poltical controvery 

Very tall (> 6 1'' ) get A+ in computer vision class 
Cohesion: Trashbin ( random / coincidental) / not resuable 



Cheating in 
Acceptable:
temporal :actions normally happen in time sequence (p>0.8)- normally happens in time 
sequence , coreltion high 

procedural: prev actions necessary condition to later ones, cause and effect (p>0.95: beyond resoable dou)
Scientific study: investigate cause and ffect (p>0.95: beyond reasoabble ) 

Cohesion: 
0. Trashbin 
based on the scenarios we may have different scenarios 
1. temporal: Hearsay
2. Procedural: Reproducable / Repeatable 
Deers: eat some tree bark
take X medicine / advil 
the illness is cured 





Level 5: Communication- One file, all actions about one DS is within this file/class/module 
std
proc: prior to OOP 


Level 6a/ 6b: 
6a: (FUNCTIONAL) One action/Feature/function : Most reusable case
non-oop: fp, proc, ....
module should be reasonably small 
1000 line function: bad 
10, 20 : bad , too many modules / 
function is too short (<20)


early 80s 
OOP later 80s

6b: (INFORMATIONAL) Well defined class in OOP (3NF) 
unless you see the class definition, never label as 

communication (level 5) vs informational (level 6b)
level 5: One data structure, many functional about DS 
6b) mmever variables, many member functions  (UNless you see the class def, never label as


OOP vs WELL DEVELOPED PROCEDURAL PL
benefit of OOP : most important / crucial/ attractive feature of OOP over .. 
------inheritance: change once, felt many places , feature localization 


7 levels of cohesion ( tashbin -- function/inf) 

COUPLING -- more loose the better 
worst --> content coupling - one module can access / change the private/ state var of another
module 
feature/ keywork allow - friend function 
<< >> overload input and output then you have to use friend function 
protected - family property children 

people; ladies; age 
men: weight/ salary/ GPA/ scores in calc III

Computational Math

static : global variable inside a class 
- of student in std class 

1. Content - cloest
2. Common - allow global variable for two modules 
----------very close, try to avoid it if possible 
----------try not to use global whenever possible 
----------feel sorry : one paragraph to explain 
---------global - improve the understandibility of codes 
---how to declare global in java - dont try to learn in global variable
3. Control - one module A call another module B, then returned value determine different actions 
--accepted coupling - from A, B is already a black box 
4. Stamp : not all data passed between two modules are useful 
5. Data : Al data passed are useful 
6. No direct relation is the best

Obama - > indirect links we can use to finally have a relation with Obama 
Obama 7 degree is enough 
JWei -> SF-> Professor in Columbia - > Obama -> Trump 
table idea for coupling - draw this table so that you wotn forget any kidn of relation 
-- exam( some modules -- what cohesion level is it ? 
b) modules what couple module this is ? then you give this table --
A &B -- then justoify for coupling 

--- cross out all the diagonals-----
    A    B     C
A   X
B   X    X
C   X    X     X

Go to statemrnt - 
Module A -
;;;
;;;
 got to label 1
 - got is bad, very bad
 
 Module B;
 ;;;
 privacies
 label 1
 weightt , $$, old
 ;;;
 
 which coupling module is this ? 
 - Answer -
 -Common 
- Control -
- Content - yes -- it is correct - module B has privacy - Dijkstra axiom : 
anyone use goto should be arrested 



A -> std object to. B , in getName (Object)
A- std name to B

mA; time=10
val- (module) B(i,j) //call module B with i,j 
if val>0....
cout<<"good"
else 
cout<<"bad"



m B- 
cout <<time;

YOUR PRIVACY IS VIOLATED 

Computational math - 



may 1st 
Rewrite mergesort using loops
with same strategy as MS, spare computer the top down sep, handle BU evaluation only 
Human+Computer : chess 

Rec: book keep effort by computer 
top down separation: use lots of system stacks/ spaces
to keep the evidence : bad for computer good for humans 
bottom-up merging : computer good
1-element array is sorted :
L: enlarge L to 2^m, 2^m-1 < L <=2^m
first merge 1-element "arrays"
next: mergee 2nd elemtn array 
next- merge 4 elements arrays
next: mergee 2^n element 
top loop-log(n)
lower loop: O(n)
0(n log n)

edit distance (DP):coarse 
hte: 
1. the (1 reversal); 
2. hate (one insertion)
3. he (delete) 4. hoe 
which is most likely to use ) 
science - popularity of the word 
google tren : stats/ Basian Based

1. edit distance 10s 100s of choices with small 1,2
2. popularity/frequency 
No cheating : 
greedy algorithm ;summarize
best choice in the current step (locally best ) 


aet: tea (too long, 4)
at: 1 deletion
editing action: delete , insert, replace 

look at w11-- sure in midterm - legal and security responsibilities 



------may 13th 
final : once coding (PL) > 2 hr
use PL (tell), understandble : comments , function/ variable names meaningful 
testing - passive testing : by observations / code reading 
active testing - by experimentation , mor eimportant 
design test cases / expected results / compare notes 
top-down testing - top level features till finally all basic/ leaf 
higher level: drivers
vs bottomup -testing - stub 

which one is preffered : TD: based specifications 
> 90% using one of these 2: 90% + vs BU: 10% - 
1. overall feature / funcntion is more important than the local ones
2. no/ little time to test all the low level features

NASA: missed one, 

BU: solidfooting 
main {
f(1)
f(2)
}
f(2)
