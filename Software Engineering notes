horseracing : 25 horses find champion 
most fair 

5-lane trucks 
top 3 in the non-controversial manner 
timing : horse not right 
algorithm _--- plan the race 

minimize the number of races 

5 runs --- heats ( 5 groups, eachgroup has 5 horses ; each has 5:5 heat champ 
5 races 
hot to decide g/s/b medals 
next 
No.6 race is heat-champion race : 
HCs run : 
top 3 in this heat champion race (no. 6)claim gold dilver bronze medal 
anyone can complain (reasonable) 
 eill get gold medal ? fair reward gold 
 who should get silver medal ? no 1 in heat 3 
 no 2 in heat 3 may complain 
 give this guy one more opp
 
 No. 2 in Race 6 silver
 22 ccny professor, 3 oly champion 
 1 in heat 3
 2 in heat 4 
 
 No 7 race: 
 decide s/ b -- will not cause any complaints 
 race 6 : 2 3 (2)
 3 more potential whiners: in heat (gold): NO. 2 , No.3 
 1 left : No.2 (in heat) of no.2 in Race

  gzip/compress/zip/winzip: dictionary based compression 
  assign short code /index to popular terms 
  huffman : entopy 
  Shannon's1st axiom: 
  assign shoter codes to those more popular signals 
  huffman algorithm 
  .gz, .z, .zip 
  cuny : 4 ascii : 4 bytes 
  
  compression: data redundance 
  gaussian 
  rand (256, 256); meaningless image 
  human face : lots of structure (spatial redumm)
  human skin color : small sub set of all digital colors 
  
  
  width height of a picture 
  256*256 gray scale image : how many difference digital pictures 
  we can have in theory ? 
  # of pixels 256* 256 
  256*256*256= 256^3
  (256)^(256*256) 
  
  counting : 
  pixels -one byte (8 bit: 0-255) 
  
  image compression : 1000+ 
  300 pic 70%

  loss less : gzip/wiinzip: jpeg, png/tiff, medical image 
  CS/EE/phycis /math : IP lossy
